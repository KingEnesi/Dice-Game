        <p><span class="star">*</span> On a turn, a player rolls the dice ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as
          many points as
          possible, adding up (hold)
          the
          numbers rolled on the dice ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a <span>1</span>, the player's turn is over and any
          points they have
          accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a <span>1</span> doesn't wipe out your entire score from
          previous
          turns,
          just the total earned during that particular roll.

          A player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a
          <span>1</span>
          and
          losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that
          turn are added to his or her score.

          When a player reaches a total of <span>100</span> points, the game ends and that player is the
          winner.
