# Dice-Game
This game is called Dice Game.
You can play it with your friend but you can also
play it by your self. Playing this game with friends or
someone else can be way much fun than playing it alone.

How to play:

In this game you have to roll the dice and set the score to 150 in order to win,
so the first player to score 150 wins.

By rolling the dice,the number which you rolled will be added to current score,but if
you roll 1 your current score will be resetted to 0.

But by pressing the hold button you keep your current score safe and your turn passes.

After the game is finished you can click the NEW GAME button to play again!


GOOD LUCK!
AND HAVE FUN ðŸ˜ƒ
